The following is from the memoirs of Mrs. Lawrence VanVleck, who taught for many years in several of the rural schools that are now part of the North Rose - Wolcott and Red Creek central school systems. Later she taught at the old Wolcott school and later at Leavenworth. The first part of this article, which describes her youth, is faded and much of it is illegible, but the part detailing her experiences as a teacher are preserved in its entirety.
<p>
She mentions five rural schools:
<p>
1. <b>The Cobblestone School</b>, which needs no introduction to Wolcott people as it is one of the most famous historic sites in the Wolcott area.
<p>
2. <b>The Butler Center School</b>, which was located at the intersection of Butler Center Road and McCann Roads. There is not a trace left of that old school, that area being all open field nowadays.
<p>
3. <b>The Fox School</b>, which was located on the Livingstone Road south of the West Butler / Whiskey Hill area. The Montana Road used to continue straight along Wolcott Creek and come out on the Livingston Road. The schoolhouse was located at that old intersection. I am not sure if the building that is there now is the original school house or not.
<p>
4. <b>The Cole School</b>, which is the schoolhouse seen in the photo, is located on Wolcott Road in the town of Butler, just past the Van Deusen Farm. The Van Deusen Farm was once called the “Cole Farm”, which is why that rural district was called the Cole school in Mrs. VanVleck’s memoirs.
<p>
<blockquote>
My first teaching experience was at <b>the Cobblestone School District 1</b>, Town of Butler. The trustee was Joseph Roe, who paid me $8.00 per week and I did my own janitorial work, swept, dusted, built fires, carried in wood from an adjoining shed and washed blackboards. I boarded with Mr. and Mrs. Roe paying $2.00 a short week and $2.50 a long week. I had six pupils. They carried their lunches in pails or boxes and placed them in a cupboard for that purpose. At noon, in the winter we served baked potatoes or hot cocoa. The girls took charge of that. We ate our lunches huddling around an old box stove which was placed in the center of the room. During the noon hour on very cold days we played "42" or card games and "Blind Man's Bluff". In the summer, "Duck on the Rock", "Tag", and "Ball". The teacher supervised the games and played with the children.
<p>
The following two years I taught <b>the Butler Center school</b>, a much larger school. I had kindergarten through seventh grade. George Candee was trustee. He paid me $8.50 per week. I still did my own janitor work and walked to and from school, a distance of four miles. Frequently I had a ride, but walking was considered good exercise in those days. There were very few automobiles then.
<p>
The next year I taught <b>the Fox school in the Bert Everhart district</b>. I had six pupils. We had wonderful times.
<p>
In 1913, I married Lawrence VanVleck and returned to <b>the Cobblestone</b> to teach, receiving $9.50 and was allowed $1.00 extra for janitor work. Wages were gradually increasing. The school year had been extended from 32 weeks to 34 weeks. During the winter for several years I traveled <b>by skiis or snowshoes</b>. I made a hard beaten path through the fields and woods. I enjoyed this mode of travel very much.
<p>
In 1928, I was offered <b>the Cole School</b>, about four miles east of where we live. This school had the name of being "tough". I accepted and received $10.50 per week. Edna Galloway Flatt took the Cobblestone School. The interior of the Cole School building was painted <b>a dark gray, making the room dark and unpleasant</b>, enough to make anyone "tough" to sit and "take" it! Our new trustee, Clark Reitz, redecorated the room, painting it a sunny yellow. He also made many other improvements. Our room now was cheerful and homelike. We were very proud of it and the children worked hard keeping it nice and clean.
<p>
It was during 1929 I purchased my <b>Model T Ford</b>. Now, I was really travelling - when it didn't "<b>shimmy</b>". Mrs. Ida E. Cosad (Wadsworth), our Dist. Superintendent, made periodical calls, giving rural teachers help and advice. She was wonderful! She usually made her rounds with <b>horse and buggy</b>.
<p>
After teaching the Cole School, I returned to Butler Center, where I had some very large pupils. I recall one boy who had just arrived from Michigan, making a remark to the children, that where he came from, <b>if pupils didn't like a teacher, they threw her out!</b> "Willie" never threw me out, but I was always on my guard.
<p>
</blockquote>
This was not an idle threat. There are reports in the old newspapers of teachers being assaulted and thrown out of schools in North Victory and in Red Creek.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>On Arbor Day</b>, if pleasant, we went to the woods after a tree to set out on the school grounds. <b>Most of the maples about the Cobblestone</b> were set out by some of my older pupils. I am sure they will recall their part in the ceremony. We studied Nature Study first-hand, by taking field trips and collecting specimens of wood flowers, weeds, and leaves, also frogs and even snakes. On one occasion, we saw a flying squirrel. <b>The boys found a snake</b>, which they placed in a fish globe. During the night it got out and crawled in the back of my desk. There was quite a commotion when it crawled out the next morning.
<p>
A few years before the rural school were consolidated, we had a special day in May known as "Field Day" at South Butler. During the day, a spelling contest was given to the best spellers of each school. The winner was to compete at the County Contest at Lyons. Mr. Robert Bradbury was in charge of the sports and activities. There were relay races, high jumps, broad jumps, three-legged races, 50-yard dash, etc. The children were thrilled with these sports. The winners received prizes. When we wished to raise money for something special, we sold candy or had <b>a box social</b>, <b>fish pond</b>, and some sort of entertainment. We usually received a satisfactory amount of money.
<p>
</blockquote>
<b>A box social</b> was an event where women would make box lunches and then men would bid on the lunch and win the right to eat it with the girl or lady who made it. The boxes were anonymous, but sometimes a girl would drop hints to the man she liked, hopping he would bid for her box. The bidding was quit lively and humorous with all kinds of joking and teasing. A notable example is the second act of the musical Oklahoma!, which is set at a box social. <b>A fish pond</b> was a kind of carnival game where you would "fish" in some kind of tank of water for prizes.
<p>
<blockquote>
In 1932, I entered <b>the "old" Wolcott School</b>, taking Nettie Foster's fourth grade. (I believe she took the seventh grade.) I had a very large class (43 pupils), there being only one teacher to a grade. I received a salary of $1,000. Mr. Ralph Herre was principal.
<p>
The following year, I taught fourth grade in <b>the American Legion room</b> (while the new Leavenworth was under construction). We had a long flight of stairs to climb. Our room was long and narrow and poorly lighted. We had to use <b>artificial lighting</b> constantly. On pleasant days, we went to the park for recreation.
<p>
In 1924, <b>the new Leavenworth Central School</b> was completed. Teachers and pupils were delighted with their rooms. My room was on the northwest corner of the building. It was sunny and pleasant. After Mr. Herre left Wolcott, Mr. R.W. Crouse took his place as principal. They were both very cooperative. I taught at the new school until 1953. Illness in the family obliged me to retire. I have enjoyed retired life very much, keeping busy doing housework (of course), church work, art, and several hobbies, and teaching Religious Instruction part of the year. The children were wonderful and loved their work. I took keen interest reading the articles on "Reading Through the Grades" by Mr. O'Connon and the teachers. Teaching has been a great pleasure to me in both the rural and Centralized schools. I miss the work very much and the association with children and faculty. <b>(May 16th, 1957)</b>
